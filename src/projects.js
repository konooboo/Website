        overview: "Link is a comprehensive public transport UI/UX design project that reimagines how commuters can navigate urban transportation. This design puts a modern twist on existing transport apps through a user-focused approach, creating an intuitive interface that ensures users can plan their journeys with confidence.",
        problem: "After experiencing the frustrations of existing public transport apps, I realized there was no real one size fits all Public Transport app. Carrying on from a university project, I identified issues with public transport systems in New Zealand. Time spent in Denmark inspired me to implement similar forms of public transport navigation, catered towards real users and accounting for all kinds of groups - elderly, regular commuters, and accessible users among others. Traditional apps often prioritize features over usability, leading to confusion and missed connections for commuters who need reliable journey planning.",

                    <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
                    <p>The colour palette was selected to ensure accessibility and visual hierarchy. The primary colors provide contrast for text and interactive elements, while the secondary palette supports the overall design language. This approach ensured consistency across all components and maintains the app's appearance, if I were to revisit this I would add a stronger contrasting colour, to aid the hierarchy and some more distinctive elements</p>

Each interaction has been fleshed out, with transitions, micro-animations, and state changes that bring the interface to life. This allows demonstraton of real user flows including journey planning, ticket purchase, and a fully functional map. Allowing experience of the app's functionality before real development.</p>
